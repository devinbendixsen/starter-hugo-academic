I am currently working as a Staff Bioinformatician in the Institute of Genetics and Cancer at the University of Edinburgh.

Previously I worked in the lab of Rike Stelkens (Stockholm University) on the evolutionary genomics of _Saccharomyces_ yeast hybrids. Before that I was a PhD student with Eric Hayden (Boise State University) studying the evolutionary implications of RNA fitness landscapes.
